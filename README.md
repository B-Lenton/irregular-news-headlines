# Irregular News Headlines

##### A JavaScript project for generating random news headlines

This project was created as part of the Just IT Bootcamp; every step from the planning and design through to the creation and implementation was independent.

The project calls [The Guardian's REST API](https://open-platform.theguardian.com/) to collect 500 current news headlines. The resulting data is then parsed into nine word categories using [Compromise NLP](https://github.com/spencermountain/compromise) and trimmed in varying ways.
